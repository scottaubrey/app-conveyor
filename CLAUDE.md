# App Conveyor

A deployment pipeline tracker for GitOps workflows. It monitors commits from a source repository through each stage of delivery — CI build, container image push, Flux CD reconciliation, Kubernetes rollout — and surfaces the status of every commit in a web UI.

## Key concepts

- **Pipeline** — a named sequence of steps defined in `conveyor.yaml`
- **Package** — a tracked commit moving through a pipeline, identified by `{pipelineId}:{commitHash}`
- **Step** — a single stage in a pipeline (git, gha, ghcr, gh-pr, flux-image, flux-kustomize, k8s-deploy)
- **Upstream** — outputs from passed steps (commitHash, imageTag, imageDigest, etc.) propagated to downstream steps

## Architecture

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` | Entry point — loads config, starts engines, starts server |
| `src/engine.ts` | Polling loop — discovers commits, advances packages through steps |
| `src/db.ts` | SQLite persistence — packages, step states, step history |
| `src/server.ts` | HTTP server — UI routes and sync endpoints |
| `src/render.ts` | Server-side HTML rendering |
| `src/config.ts` | YAML config loading |
| `src/kube.ts` | Kubernetes client with Bun TLS workaround |
| `src/modules/` | One file per step type |

The engine polls each pipeline on a configurable interval. Each poll discovers new commits (git step) and advances all in-progress packages by calling the appropriate module for each step in sequence. A step returning `pending` or `running` stops advancement for that package until the next poll.

## Bun

- Use `bun <file>` instead of `node <file>` or `ts-node <file>`
- Use `bun test` instead of jest or vitest
- Use `bun install` instead of npm/yarn/pnpm
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of npm/yarn/pnpm run
- Use `bunx <package>` instead of npx
- Bun automatically loads `.env` — don't use dotenv
- `Bun.serve()` for the HTTP server — don't use express
- `bun:sqlite` for SQLite — don't use better-sqlite3
- `Bun.file` instead of `node:fs` readFile/writeFile

## Testing

Run `bun run check` after any code change. This runs `biome check`, `tsc --noEmit`, and `bun test`. All three must pass before a task is considered complete.

```ts
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("example", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

## UI

The frontend is server-side rendered HTML only — plain string templates in `src/render.ts`. Do not add client-side JavaScript: no `<script>` tags, no inline event handlers, no `fetch()` from the browser. Use `<form method="POST">` for actions and HTTP 303 redirects from the server.

## Kubernetes TLS

Bun's `fetch()` ignores `https.Agent`, so the standard Node.js mechanism for injecting CA certs does not work. This is already solved in `src/kube.ts` using `wrapHttpLibrary` from `@kubernetes/client-node`, which extracts the CA/cert/key from the agent and passes them via Bun's non-standard `tls` fetch option. Do not reach for `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` or process re-exec as a solution to Kubernetes TLS issues.

## GitHub API

Fine-grained PATs cannot access organisation-owned packages via the GitHub Packages API — this is a GitHub platform limitation. A classic PAT with `read:packages` and `repo` scopes is required for any pipeline that uses the `ghcr` step against org-owned images.

## Known gotcha: image tag hash matching

Image tags often embed the commit hash with a `g` prefix (trunkver format: `{timestamp}-g{hash}-{runId}`). A segment-based `startsWith(hash)` check will never match. Use `includes(shortHash)` where `shortHash = imageTag.slice(0, 7)`. This affects ghcr tag matching, flux-image comparison, and k8s-deploy image confirmation — all already handled, but watch for it in any new tag comparison code.
